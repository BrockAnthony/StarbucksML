# StarbucksML

Starbucks Offers Data Analysis and Classification Model

Description
The goal of this project was to analyze simulated Starbucks data and build classification models to identify the most effective offers for customers. The data was obtained through the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program, and I utilized NumPy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to conduct data analysis and build the models. I used scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier machine learning model to classify consumer offers, delivering an impressive F1-score of 85%.
